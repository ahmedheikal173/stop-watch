🕰 Behold, our Stop Watch System 🕰

Key Features:
1. ATmega32 Microcontroller @ 1MHz
2. Timer1 in CTC mode for precise timing
3. Six Common Anode 7-segment displays, ingeniously multiplexed
4. Control with a 7447 decoder and NPN BJT transistors
5. Start, pause, and resume functionality with external interrupts

🔌 Simply power up the MCU, and our stopwatch springs to life! ⏱

This project highlights my prowess in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and creative thinking. Immensely grateful to Engineering Mohamed Tarek for being the guiding light throughout. 🙏
